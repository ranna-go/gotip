# gotip

An unofficial Go toolchain Docker image using [gotip](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip) to provide the latest development toolchains of Go. This image is primarily made to be used as runtime spec in ranna, but you can use it for your own purpose of course, if you want.

```
docker pull ghcr.io/ranna-go/gotip:latest
```
